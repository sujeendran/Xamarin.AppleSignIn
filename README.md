# Xamarin.AppleSignIn

A simple class library to help setup Apple SignIn in Xamarin Forms and azure backend projects when working with different solutions. Just published to nuget store since the original Apple SignIn example provided [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/platform/sign-in-with-apple/) had the library as a separate project within the same solution and was not what I was looking for. 

Maybe others might find it useful in a similar manner.
